## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Firebase Cloud Functions)

#### Core Services

- **badgeFunctions.js**: Cloud Function triggers and endpoints

#### Cloud Functions
- `initializeBadges`: Initialize badge definitions in Firestore
- `awardBadgeManually`: Admin function to manually award badges
- `getBadgeProgress`: Get user's badge progress
- `checkBadgesOnUserCreate`: Award badges when user signs up
- `checkBadgesOnCollectionUpdate`: Check badges when cards are added
- `checkBadgesOnTradeComplete`: Award trading badges
- `checkBadgesOnPostCreate`: Award social badges
- `checkBadgesOnDeckCreate`: Award deck building badges
- `checkBadgesOnPublicDeckCreate`: Award sharing badges
- `checkBadgesOnFollow`: Award friend badges
- `checkBadgesOnArticlePublish`: Award content creation badges
- `checkBadgesOnGroupCreate`: Award community badges
- `checkBadgesOnProfileUpdate`: Award profile completion badges
- `checkBadgesOnMarketplaceListing`: Award marketplace badges
- `dailyBadgeCheck`: Scheduled daily badge verification
- `retroactivelyAwardBadges`: Award badges to existing users

### Frontend (JavaScript)

#### Badge System Library (`badgeSystem.js`)
- Badge loading and display
- Progress tracking
- Notification system
- Real-time updates
- Statistics calculation

#### Badges Page (`badges.html`)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode support
- Tab-based navigation
- Real-time badge updates
- Mobile-friendly interface

### Database Schema (Firestore)

```
/badgeDefinitions/{badgeId}
  - id, name, description, category
  - icon, rarity, points, criteria

/users/{userId}/badges/{badgeId}
  - badgeId, earnedAt, notified

/users/{userId}/private/badgeStats
  - totalBadges, totalPoints
  - categoryCounts, lastBadgeEarned

/badgeAwardLogs/{logId}
  - userId, badgeId, awardedBy
  - awardedAt, type
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Badge Awarding

1. **User Action**: User performs an action (e.g., adds a card to collection)
2. **Trigger Activation**: Firestore trigger detects the change
3. **Criteria Check**: Badge service checks if criteria are met
4. **Badge Award**: If criteria met, badge is added to user's collection
5. **Notification**: User receives real-time notification
6. **Stats Update**: User's badge statistics are updated

### Badge Criteria Types

The system supports various criteria types:

- **Threshold-based**: Reach a specific count (e.g., 100 cards)
- **Action-based**: Complete a specific action (e.g., first trade)
- **Quality-based**: Achieve a quality metric (e.g., 10+ positive reviews)
- **Time-based**: Join before a specific date (e.g., early adopter)
- **Completion-based**: Complete a set or collection
- **Combination**: Multiple criteria combined (e.g., profile picture + bio)

### Progress Tracking

Users can track their progress toward earning badges:

- **Current Progress**: Shows current count vs. required count
- **Percentage**: Visual progress bar with percentage
- **Next Milestone**: Highlights badges close to completion
- **Recommendations**: Suggests actions to earn badges

## Best Practices
