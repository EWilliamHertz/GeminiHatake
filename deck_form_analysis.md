# Deck Builder Form Layout Analysis

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Form Layout Structure
- **Current**: Basic grid layout with `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4` for Deck Name and Game selection
- **Issue**: The layout is functional but lacks professional polish and proper spacing

### 2. Form Element Organization
- **Deck Name and Game Selection**: Currently in a 2-column grid (good foundation)
- **Format Selection**: Hidden by default, appears when game is selected (functionality works)
- **Form Elements**: All elements are stacked vertically with basic spacing

### 3. Button Layout Issues
- **Current Button Container**: `.deck-builder-buttons` class with no specific styling
- **Button Arrangement**: Buttons are not properly aligned or spaced
- **Button Styling**: Individual button styles are defined but container lacks organization

### 4. Spacing and Visual Hierarchy
- **Margins**: Basic `mb-4` spacing between sections
- **Visual Separation**: Lacks clear visual separation between form sections
- **Professional Appearance**: Missing modern form styling touches

### 5. Responsive Design
- **Current**: Basic responsive grid that works but could be improved
- **Mobile Experience**: Needs better mobile-specific styling
