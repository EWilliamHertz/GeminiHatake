## Core Social & Community Features: Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the successful implementation of core social and community features for the Hatake TCG platform. The primary objective was to transform Hatake from a set of individual tools into an interactive, community-driven platform, and this has been achieved through the following key features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Group Creation & Management

A comprehensive group system has been implemented, allowing users to create, join, and manage public or private groups. The system includes:

- **Advanced Group Creation Form:** With fields for name, description, category, tags, visibility, and moderation settings.
- **Real-time Group Search:** Users can easily find groups based on their interests.
- **Improved UI:** A modern and intuitive interface for browsing and managing groups.

#### 2. Real-time Group Chat

Each group now has a dedicated, persistent chat channel for real-time conversations. The chat system features:

- **Live Messaging:** Powered by Firebase Firestore for instant message delivery.
- **File & Image Sharing:** Users can share files and images within the chat.
- **Typing Indicators:** To enhance the real-time communication experience.
- **Professional Interface:** A clean and modern chat UI.

#### 3. Unified User Profiles

A unified profile page has been created to consolidate all user-specific information and establish a strong user identity on the platform. The new profiles include:

- **Comprehensive Overview:** Showcasing recent activity, collection highlights, and key stats.
- **Tabbed Interface:** For easy navigation between Collection, Decks, Trade History, and Activity.
- **Social Discovery:** Profiles are viewable by other users to encourage connection and interaction.

#### 4. Gaming Platform Account Integration

To further connect players, the profile system has been enhanced to include gaming platform account integration. Users can now add their account names for:

- **Magic: The Gathering:** MTG Arena, Magic Online (MTGO), and Untap.in.
- **Pokémon:** Pokémon TCG Online and Pokémon TCG Live.
- **Yu-Gi-Oh!:** Master Duel and Dueling Book.
- **Other Platforms:** Tabletop Simulator, Cockatrice, and Discord.

These accounts are displayed on the user's profile, making it easy for others to find and play with them.

### Bug Fixes & Enhancements

- **Corrected Profile Data Loading:** The profile system now correctly loads and displays collection data, even when the database structure varies.
- **Removed Placeholder Content:** All placeholder data has been removed, and the profile now shows proper empty states when no data is available.
- **Improved UI/UX:** The overall user interface has been enhanced with better data presentation, error handling, and a more professional design.

### File Manifest
