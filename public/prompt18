It took a while to load index.html, but when we did this came up in console:
Failed to initialize currency rates: TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'USD')
    at initCurrency (currency.js:21:28)
    at async auth.js:330:13
initCurrency @ currency.js:24Understand this error

1. The copies of the card is in a white box wihtout any visible information except "1x", see screenshot.
2. The copies of cards have no image.
3. The price is still saying N/A on all of the cards in the card list.
4. The additional pending copies is still there although the card selected is different.
5. Not all Pokemon cards for i.e "Abra" shows up in the search result.
Please fetch files from the conversation history to see if they have been updated, if not, take them from github repository.
If you cannot find a file, ask for it so you Ã§an merge the new code with the original.
Thanks.
