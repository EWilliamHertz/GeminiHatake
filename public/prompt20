1. This winds up in the console at index.html:

2. The prices are still wrong, it still says 1700+ whilst the cards are less than 50kr.
3. The edit card, add copies doesn't work. And you can BARELY (after 10+ clicks) click on the copies to edit them.
4. When you enter the copied card, all other copies are removed.
5. There is no X to delete a copy.

Do we have to change the cloud functions for the currency changer?
