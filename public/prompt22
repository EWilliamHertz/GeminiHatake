1. It still doesn't say prices, it just says N/A on all the cards in card search.
2. In my_collection.html it says cards cost singular crowns, some N/A yet the value of the collection is worth over 1000kr it says in the statistics.
3. When we try to add a card this comes up in console:
collection-app.js:127 Error saving card: FirebaseError: Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field api_id in document users/x2aA4S7oGJhsBir61yJonFLIqTM2/collection/hEx4Qr09eKUbUktZlEHE)

4. The picture doesn't get changed when we upload a photo to the card.
5. We cannot hover over a card to enlargen it in the card-search or in my collection, it should be possible to both.
6. We cannot click on the card to edit it, we need to click the edit button.
