1. The prices for my_collection.html on the Magic cards say N/A or 0 instead of the actual price from scryfall.
2. We cannot hover over the cards to have an enlarged picture over or cursor.
3. The collection statistics is incorrect, it says 1500 total value when the total value of the cards doesn't exceed 100.
4. We cannot add or edit cards.
Can you pull github and host it to localhost and try the website out and fix my_collection.html?
