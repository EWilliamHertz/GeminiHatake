1. The filter buttons for Magic doesn't work.
2. When you go into the Pokemon tab, there should be filter options for Pokemon cards as well.
3. The Pokemon editions shouldn't show up in the editions dropdown menu when you are in the Magic the Gathering tab, and vice versa.
4. It is not possible to save custom images, this shows up in console:
