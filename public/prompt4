1. The csv upload button doesn't work.
2. The + button on card search (manual) results doesn't work, this comes up in console:
card-search.js:67 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'openCardManagementModal')
    at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (card-search.js:67:34)
(anonymous)    @    card-search.js:67
3. Bulk-edit delete doesn't work, it needs to get removed from firestore database. Rules allows users to edit their own collections, so should the code.
4. Manually deleting temporarily removes it, until the page is refreshed. Then it comes back.
5. The total cards and unique cards shouldn't be the same in wish-list and my collection (the stats) you should be able to view the total cost of the cards you wish for.
