1. The bulk edit, delete cards doesn't work.
2. We cannot click search by enter or manually click the search button for manual add cards.
3. We cannot manually delete things, it temporarily dissapears and when we refresh it is back. Please delete them from firestore database.
4. We cannot bulk list for sale, it is supposed to come up with a modal where it asks us for what % of market price we want to list all cards, or advanced settings where we can write % of each individual card or a fixed price.
5. It doesn't work to click the "upload csv" button.
